# Buildsquad
This document ise a draft of what we want buildsquad to be.


## What
> TODO: insert catchy description for buildsquad

Free, Opensource, easy to administer build test server that scales from your laptop to the cloud.


## Goals

- we want it to be easy to use, with close-to-zero configuration in the simplest case.
- The simplest case being you working on your project on your laptop/desktop
- it should be easy to offload of builds to a different machine
- it should be easy to add more machines to offload work to
- command-line driven (i.e. no webui for now)
- use containers when different targets are needed
- support incremental/full builds.
- a build can be (almost) anything, from building or testing an application, to test full machine bootstrap
- last target is continuous deployment
- client/server model
- client should be portable
- targeting (modern) linux for the server


## Technologies
TBD (but we have an idea ;))

## Architecture
